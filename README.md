# Pure JavaScript Practice
Simple application to help me understand how one might build a front-end without using React (or Angular/Vue etc.)

# Background
I never formally learned JavaScript or Web Development, I sort of just came into the middle of a ReactJS project and enjoyed it. As such, I don't always know what frameworks like ReactJS actually *buy* for the developer. More importantly, though, I don't always know what they *cost*. This project will hopefully help me gain some perspective on those issues.

# The App
I want to make a simple character sheet that:
- Tracks HP and allows one to modify it.
- Lists all six major stats.
- Lists inventory and allows a player to update inventory.

# Notes

Rather than half-heartedly following good comment conventions, I'm going to have fun with this project and just make commit comments my thoughts on how this is going.

I will start this project by following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/pure-javascript-building-a-real-world-application-from-scratch-5213591cfcd6).
